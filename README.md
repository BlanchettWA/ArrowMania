# Arrow Mania
A Game Programming final created in Processing. Essentially, DDR on keyboard but without music syncronization.

Currently, this requres [Processing](https://processing.org/) to run. There will be exported executable versions soon. 

---------------------------
## Known issues: 
Sound is unreliable and may work if enabled, but also may not. The Java Virtual machine crashes either on first run or on opening the game. 

------------------------
## Next steps: 
* Uploading exported zips of the game
* Further code cleanup
* Porting to Unity

*I'd be honored if you want to use/adapt/modify this, just let me know what you do with it!*
